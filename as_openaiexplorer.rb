Name :          OpenAIExplorer (Experimental)

Version:        2.3

Date :          5/18/2024

Description :   An experimental extension to use OpenAIâ€™s services to create or manipulate geometry in SketchUp using natural language.

History:        1.0 (3/18/2023):
                - first version
                1.0.1 (3/24/2023):
                - Added cleanup for the returned code/text
                - Added error handling for API and a one-time warning for the extension
                1.0.2 (3/28/2023):
                - Fixed error handling bug
                - Added a double-check for delete requests
                1.0.3 (7/19/2023):
                - Added license/disclaimer file
                - Added better license display on first use
                - Added link to OpenAI TOU to menu
                - Reverted the prompt prefix to a text box (user can now enter anything)
                - Disabled code execution as the default (can be turned on in settings)
                - Changed from OpenAI completion model to chat model (OpenAI changes), see:
                  https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-api-general-availability
                2.0 (7/23/2023):
                - Created dialog-based input for more chat-like experience
                - Moved error reporting into dialog to reduce pop-ups
                2.1 (9/23/2023):
                - Better error handling
                - Fixed gpt-4 markdown extraction issue
                - Added a timer
                - Set a 30 seconds read timeout for hung requests
                2.2 (12/9/2023):
                - Implemented correct system message handling as per OpenAI API
                - Added system message to prevent file access when code is to be executed
                - Updated default system message
                - Added menu item to reset extension settings (for troubleshooting)
                2.3 (5/18/2024):
                - Updated some defaults
                - Updated button design
                - Added AI "memory". User can now select how many messages get sent to OpenAI.                
                - Added screenshot image upload for vision-capable models (e.g. gpt-4o)
                - Added resolution control for uploaded images
                2.4 ():
                - Now renders bold text and code visually in responses
                - Better response handling
                - Dialog now always opens centered
