OpenAI Explorer (Experimental) Extension for SketchUp
=====================================================

Use OpenAI's services to create or manipulate geometry, write Ruby code, or analyze SketchUp models, all using natural language

IMPORTANT! PLEASE NOTE:
=======================

This is an experimental extension, which is able to fully automate SketchUp using its Ruby scripting engine (if code execution is enabled). This can even affect your entire file system because SketchUp has unrestricted, user level access to that. Use with caution and at your own risk! When in doubt, do not enable code execution in the extension’s settings (it is disabled by default).

Any AI generated content may contain errors, fabrications, or may not be usable at all. Use any generated content at your own discretion. Therefore, use this tool with caution and experiment with prompts if you run into errors. Sometimes it helps to simply re-word the prompt.

This extension is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI.
